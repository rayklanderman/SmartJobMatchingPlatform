# 💼 Smart Job Matching Platform (Kenya)

> A data-driven platform that uses AI to match unemployed youth in Kenya with job opportunities tailored to their skills, education, and interests.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Youth unemployment in Kenya remains a critical challenge, with many young people struggling to find jobs that match their qualifications. This project aims to build an intelligent job matching platform to bridge the gap between youth talent and job market demands using AI, inclusive UX, and real user insights.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand the root causes of youth unemployment
- Collect and analyze job market data
- Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for smart job matching
- Design with empathy and inclusivity (e.g. accessible UI, sign language interpretation)
- Deliver a pitch-ready prototype and product roadmap
